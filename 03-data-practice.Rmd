What does this mean? The term **ethical data practice** has many meanings and components, the three we will focus on in this section are given below.

 1.  **Accuracy and Honesty:** Being accurate and honest in your analyses and conclusions.

 2.  **Respectful Handling of Data:** Recognize that data may represents people or beliefs or behaviour and be respectful of this.

 3.  **Awareness of Consequences:** Considering the ethical implications and societal impact of your research.


In summary, when dealing with data we have should always aim to be accurate, honest, respectful and act responsibly. There are many ongoing discussions in the scientific community around ethical data practice and what it entails. It is a hugely important subject, and in many ways has a long way to go. We only touch briefly on some aspects of ethical data practice in this section, presenting the suggestions and thoughts of trailblazing communities and organisations in those areas.

## Accuracy and Honesty

Teaching honesty is beyond the scope of this course. However, teaching you the tools so that your analysis is reproducible goes someway towards accuracy. This because, reproducibility promotes transparency, facilitates error detection and correction, and contributes to the overall reliability and accuracy of your research findings.

### Reproducibility

> "Reproducibility, also known as replicability and repeatability, is a major principle underpinning the scientific method. For the findings of a study to be reproducible means that results obtained by an experiment or an observational study or in a statistical analysis of a data set should be achieved again with a high degree of reliability when the study is replicated. ... With a narrower scope, reproducibility has been introduced in computational sciences: Any results should be documented by making all data and code available in such a way that the computations can be executed again with identical results." `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Reprodicibility, Wikipedia')`


### Project-oriented workflow: good practice

Properly managing data and other research outputs should starts at the beginning of your project. It should then and continue throughout!


**Always start with a clean workspace** **Why?** *So your ex (code) can't come and mess up your life!*

To ensure this go to **Tools** > **Global Options** and uncheck the highlighted options.

**Why?** Because, this is not reproducible, does **NOT** create a fresh `R` process, makes your script vulnerable, and it **will** come back to bite you.

  <strong>TASK</strong> Below are two quotes from [Jenny Bryan, a `R` wizard](https://jennybryan.org/about/) which referecne two snippets of `R` code. Find out what each snippet does and why Jenny is so against them.

> If the first line of your R script is
> `setwd("C:\Users\jenny\path\that\only\I\have")`
> I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE 🔥.
> If the first line of your R script is
> `rm(list = ls())`
> I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE 🔥. `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Jenny Bryan, Tidyverse blog, workflow vs script')`

A project-oriented workflow in `R` refers to a structured approach to organizing and managing your code, data, and analyses. This helps improve reproducibility and the overall efficiency of your work. Within this it is essential essential to write code that is easy to understand, maintain, and share. To do so, coding best practice is to follow the **5 Cs** by being

1. **Clear**
   - *Code Clarity:* Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use meaningful variable and function names that convey the purpose of the code. Avoid overly complex or ambiguous expressions.
   - *Comments:* Include comments to explain the purpose of your code, especially for complex or non-intuitive sections. Comments should add value without stating the obvious.

2. **Concise:**
   - *Avoid Redundancy:* Write code in a way that avoids unnecessary repetition. Reuse functions and use loops or vectorized operations when appropriate to reduce the length of your code.
   - *Simplify Expressions:* Simplify complex expressions and equations to improve readability. Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

3. **Consistent:**
   - *Coding Style:* Adhere to a consistent coding style throughout your project. Consistency in indentation, spacing, and naming conventions makes the code visually coherent.
   - *Function Naming:* Keep naming conventions consistent. If you use camelCase for variable names, continue to use it consistently across your codebase.

4. **Correct:**
   - *Error Handling:* Implement proper error handling to ensure that your code gracefully handles unexpected situations. Check for potential issues, and provide informative error messages.
   - *Testing:* Test your code to ensure it produces the correct output. Use tools like unit tests (e.g., with `testthat`) to verify that your functions work as intended.

5. **Conformant:**
   - *Follow Best Practices:* Adhere to best practices and coding standards in the R community. For example, follow the tidyverse style guide or the Google R Style Guide.
   - *Package Guidelines:* If you're creating an R package, conform to package development guidelines. Use the `usethis` package to help set up your package structure in a conformant way.


There are many other good practice tips when it comes to coding these include ensuring your code is modular, implementing unit testing, automating workflows and implementing version control. These topics, however are beyond the scope of this course (take [BIOSCI738](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/BIOSCI/738/1243) if you'd like to learn more about them).





## Respectful Handling of Data

### Data sovereignty

[''**Data sovereignty** is the idea that data are subject to the laws and governance structures within the nation it is collected''](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sovereignty)

> "For Indigenous peoples, historical encounters with statistics have been fraught, and none more so than when involving official data produced as part of colonial attempts at statecraft." `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Lovett, R., Lee, V., Kukutai, T., Cormack, D., Rainie, S.C. and Walker, J., 2019. Good data practices for Indigenous data sovereignty and governance. Good data, pp.26-36.')`

Data sovereignty emphasizes the importance of understanding and adhering to the legal and ethical considerations associated with data collection, storage, and analysis in different jurisdictions. Researchers must navigate these complexities while upholding the highest standards of integrity and respect for individuals' privacy and rights.

### Māori Data Sovereignty principles
 
 > "Māori Data Sovereignty has emerged as a critical policy issue as Aotearoa
New Zealand develops world-leading linked administrative data resources." `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Andrew Sporle, Maui Hudson, Kiri West. Chapter 5, Indigenous Data Sovereignty and Policy')`


> “Māori data refers to data produced by Māori or that is about Māori and the environments we have relationships with."  `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Te Mana Raraunga Charter')`


> Data is a “potential taonga, something precious that needs to be maintained, in relation to its utility” `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Dr W. Edwards, TMR website')`


[Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/read-the-Treaty/differences-between-the-texts) obliges the Government to actively protect [taonga](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=taonga), consult with Māori in respect of taonga, give effect to the principle of partnership and recognize Māori rangatiratanga over taonga. Factors that relate to how communities might recognize the taonga nature of any dataset include

 + **provenance** of the data: does the dataset come from a significant Māori source?
 + **opportunity** for the data: could the dataset support Māori aspirations for their people or their whenua (land)?
 + **utility** of the data: does the dataset have multiple uses?

**Māori Data Sovereignty principles** inform the recognition of Māori rights and interests in data, and promote the ethical use of data to enhance Māori wellbeing.

The [**Te Mana o te Raraunga Model**](https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz/) was developed to align Māori concepts with data rights and interests, and guide agencies in the appropriate use of Māori data. Below are the guiding principles outlined by [**Te Mana o te Raraunga Model**](https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz/) in th e [Principles of Māori Data Sovereignty](https://cdn.auckland.ac.nz/assets/psych/about/our-research/documents/TMR%2BM%C4%81ori%2BData%2BSovereignty%2BPrinciples%2BOct%2B2018.pdf).

+ **Rangatiratanga** (*authority*)

    + Māori have an inherent right to exercise control over Māori data and Māori data ecosystems. This right includes, but is not limited to, the creation, collection, access, analysis, interpretation, management, security, dissemination, use and reuse of Māori data.
    + Decisions about the physical and virtual storage of Māori data shall enhance control for current and future generations. Whenever possible, Māori data shall be stored in Aotearoa New Zealand.
    + Māori have the right to data that is relevant and empowers sustainable self-determination and effective self-governance
  
+ **Whakapapa** (*relationships*)

    + All data has a whakapapa (genealogy). Accurate metadata should, at minimum, provide information about the provenance of the data, the purpose(s) for its collection, the context of its collection, and the parties involved.
    + The ability to disaggregate Māori data increases its relevance for Māori communities and iwi. Māori data shall be collected and coded using categories that prioritise Māori needs and aspirations.
    +  Current decision-making over data can have long-term consequences, good and bad, for future generations of Māori. A key goal of Māori data governance should be to protect against future harm.
   
+ **Whanaungatanga** (*obligations*)

    + Individuals’ rights (including privacy rights), risks and benefits in relation to data need to be balanced with those of the groups of which they are a part. In some contexts, collective Māori rights will prevail over those of individuals.
    + Individuals and organisations responsible for the creation, collection, analysis, management, access, security or dissemination of Māori data are accountable to the communities, groups and individuals from whom the data derive
   
+ **Kotahitanga** (*collective benefit*)

    + Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Māori to derive individual and collective benefit.
    + Build capacity. Māori Data Sovereignty requires the development of a Māori workforce to enable the creation, collection, management, security, governance and application of data.
    + Connections between Māori and other Indigenous peoples shall be supported to enable the sharing of strategies, resources and ideas in relation to data, and the attainment of common goals.
   
+ **Manaakitanga** (*reciprocity*)

    + The collection, use and interpretation of data shall uphold the dignity of Māori communities, groups and individuals. Data analysis that stigmatises or blames Māori can result in collective and individual harm and should be actively avoided.
    + Free, prior and informed consent shall underpin the collection and use of all data from or about Māori. Less defined types of consent shall be balanced by stronger governance arrangements.
  
+ **Kaitiakitanga** (*guardianship*)

    + Māori data shall be stored and transferred in such a way that it enables and reinforces the capacity of Māori to exercise kaitiakitanga over Māori data.
    + Ethics. Tikanga, kawa (protocols) and mātauranga (knowledge) shall underpin the protection, access and use of Māori data.
    + Māori shall decide which Māori data shall be controlled (tapu) or open (noa) access.
